# World Populations II Challenge Project (SQL)
Project provided by CodeAcademy.

To get started with SQLite using DB browser, download it [here](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/)

If you want to try this project yourself, download the dataset 'world_populations_ii.sqlite' in this repository to get started!

The questions are:
1. How many entries are there in the countries table from Africa?
2. What was the total population of the continent of Oceania in 2005?
3. What was the average population of countries in South America in 2003?
4. What country had the smallest population in 2007?
5. What is the average population of Poland during the time period covered in this dataset?
6. How many countries have the letters 'The' in the name?
7. What was the total population of each continent in 2010?

My answers to these questions can be seen in 'code' file.
